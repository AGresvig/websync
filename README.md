# **websync**

*websync is intended to be an rsync task manager, where rsync tasks can be added, scheduled and maintained in a sane manner.*

## Installation

- [OS X](https://github.com/furier/websync/wiki/Installation---OS-X)
- [Ubuntu](https://github.com/furier/websync/wiki/Installation---Ubuntu)

## Roadmap

- **File Browser**, which can browse both localhost and remote targets.
- **Path autocompletion** for both localhost and remote targets when just typing the paths manually in the path list for each task.
- **ssh-copy-id** to remote targets through the web interface on the hosts tab.
